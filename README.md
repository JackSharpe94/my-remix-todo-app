# my-remix-todo-app
This is a very basic TODO app that will be used to help familiarise myself on Remix 
Feel free to collaborate by raising Pull Requests if you feel a feature would be useful
Currently no backend or frontend is complete. this is an empty template


# quick start

To start I recommend looking at the React Remix docs: 
https://remix.run/docs/en/main


to start the app clone the repo
run npm i 

npx remix build
npx remix-serve build/index.js
the above commands will change in the future. docs to be updated
